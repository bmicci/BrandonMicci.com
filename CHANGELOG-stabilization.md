# CHANGELOG â€” stabilization.patch

## Overview

This patch centralizes background animations, restores base typography and glass utilities, and replaces corrupted files that contained literal ellipses (`...`) from prior AI edits. It also removes per-section background mounts to prevent duplicate animations.

## What changed

1. **Centralized Background**
   - `src/app/layout.tsx`: Rewritten to a clean RootLayout that mounts a single `<StarsBackground/>` once at the document root, behind all content.

2. **Background Component (Safe)**
   - `src/components/StarsBackground.tsx`: Replaced with a deterministic, lightweight starfield (no external libs, respects reduced motion).

3. **Navigation**
   - `src/components/Navigation.tsx`: Replaced with a compact, stable nav (desktop + mobile). No external CSS dependence.

4. **Home Page Composition**
   - `src/app/page.tsx`: Rewritten to compose content sections _without_ importing or mounting per-section backgrounds.

5. **Global Styles**
   - `src/app/globals.css`: Added Tailwind `@layer base` for headings and `@layer components` for `.glass` and `.section` utilities.

6. **Defensive Clean-up**
   - Removed stray imports/usages of `FuturisticBackground`, `HeroBackground`, `StrategicVisionBackground`, and `TechBackground` inside components to avoid duplicate mounts.

## Why

- Multiple pages/components were corrupted (contained `...`), which breaks compilation and layout.
- Backgrounds were mounted in several places, causing z-index, banding, and performance issues.

## How to verify

- Start dev server: `npm run dev` then visit `/`
- Confirm you see a single starfield behind all pages.
- Check headings (H1/H2/H3) look consistent; glass cards use `.glass`.
- Resize to mobile and open the hamburger menu; it should function.

## Notes

- If you want alternate background styles (e.g., holograms), we can add a `variant` prop to `StarsBackground` later without re-introducing duplicates.
